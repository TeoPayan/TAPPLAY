# Tapplay

This is a personal web development project where I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript. Tapplay is my way to practice what I've learned while sharing my love of mellow, dreamy music.

## What this project is

- A simple website to curate and share music
- A sandbox to improve my front-end skills
- A way to explore web technologies as I learn

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- (Later) JavaScript

## Why I Built This

Iâ€™m learning web development on my own, and building Tapplay helps me practice by creating something I care about.
